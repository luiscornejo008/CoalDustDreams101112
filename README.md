We are currently having trouble figuring out how to sync every change in the project. Team members are able to access the project in their computer files, but no synced changes are visible yet.

We figured out how to sync changes made to Unity for everyone, now we can start working.

Imported assets do not properly show up and will not open. This is a major problem that needs to be fixed immediately, otherwise we can't make any progress on the project.

We are still trying to figure out  our game; importing/adding assets does not work on my (Luis) side, but Ryan can, so that problem is (somewhat) solved.
We still need to figure out the whole scope of the again as well as actually getting down to business.
